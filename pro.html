                    <h3>Front Desk Clerk</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money Handling, I would handle cash or credit 
                                transations for day passes or gym memberships, 
                                using the cities specialized application we would 
                                have to keep organized, detailed, and accurate records 
                                of all transactions.</li>
                            <li>Informed, I would have to look into all of the 
                                resources the recreation center offered to be able 
                                to explain concisely what benefits each pass, 
                                membership, or deal offered the patron, by clearly

                    <h3>Dental Lab Assistant</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Produce, I would work with a small team to scan, print, 
                                and craft clear aligners and retainers for patients 
                                that needed teeth alignments, We would use specialized 
                                tools to work quickly and efficiently while maintaining 
                                a high quality of care. Each aligner would be checked after 
                                every step of the creation process.</li>
                            <li>Delegated, I would request for people to work at multiple 
                                stations so that the chain of production would flow as 
                                smoothly as possible, the nature of the job was such that 
                                each person had to be working on a different task, so being 
                                able to delegate who could act in which position best was 
                                extremely important.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Plan, we would spend roughly 9-10 hours a day going out to 
                                find people to sit and share a message with, so having a 
                                plan was paramount, we would spend roughly an hour every 
                                morning planning our day to make sure we spent time as 
                                efficiently and productively as possible. </li>
                            <li>Train, I was put in a few leadership positions overlooking
                                 some other missionaries and would counsel, lead, and 
                                 encourage them to serve to the best of their abilities, 
                                 as a result I have learned how to communicate with associates 
                                 in an uplifting and confident manner.</li>
                            <li>Teach, we would sit with individuals and families and share 
                                15-30 minute lessons about the Gospel and invite others to share 
                                their thought and feelings about what we shared, as a result I 
                                have learned how to present and share information in a way that 
                                is clear and understandable, while also building connections with 
                                those that we are teaching. </li>
